Hi!
I'm Guy Sutton. I am a Research Entomologist at the Centre for Biological Control at Rhodes University (South Africa).
See [About me](/about_me) for more information about my research.

Stats for Scared Ecologists is a home for ecologists struggling through their dreaded data analysis, whether this be for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees, or researchers writing grants, papers, book chapters, and the like... This site aims to serve as a tutorial for performing an array of data analyses relevant to ecology, ranging from statistical modelling, GIS and mapping, community analyses, and writing code to perform these computations. 

Please feel free to get in contact with me via [email](mailto:statsforscaredecologists@gmail.com) if you are struggling with something - I am always looking for ideas for new tutorials and analyses.
