# Background 

My name is Guy Sutton. I am a Research Entomologist at the Centre for Biological Control at Rhodes University (South Africa). My research primarily involves finding and developing insect biological control agents for managing invasive alien plants, with a particular focus on managing invasive African grasses that have become invasive globally. Moreover, I passionate about developing quantitative methods and software for answering ecological questions, bridging the spheres of statistics, software development, coding and ecology. 

Please find my [CV](https://github.com/guysutton/cv/blob/master/script_make_cv.pdf) here.

# Work History

üè¢ **Research Entomologist (Centre for Biological Control, Rhodes University)** ~~~<span class="jobdates">(2019 - Current)</span>~~~
- Led multiple projects developing biological control of invasive weeds, focusing on controlling invasive African grasses 
- Developed and taught numerous undergrauate and postgraduate [courses and workshops](https://github.com/guysutton?tab=repositories) on quantitative methods in ecology (using R and Julia)
- Developed open-source software packages for analysing ecological datasets, e.g. [ThermalSampleR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ThermalSampleR/index.html), and [SPEDE-sampler](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13591)
